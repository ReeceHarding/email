## Current Session (2024-02-25)

### Steps Completed
* Analyzed the current project structure and existing components
* Verified the testing infrastructure is in place
* Confirmed the database schema is already set up
* Completed Phase 1, Step 1: Project Structure and Dependencies
* Created tests to verify project structure, dependencies, and build configuration
* Fixed TypeScript issues with Jest type definitions
* Created missing directories required by the project structure
* Updated Jest configuration to include tests in the __tests__ directory

### Issues Encountered
* TypeScript definitions for Jest matchers were missing, causing linter errors in test files
* Some required directories were missing in the project structure

### Decisions Made
* Created required directories: lib/hooks, components/utilities, prompts
* Added a type definition file for Jest to properly type the assertion methods
* Updated Jest configuration to include both test directories
* Used Typescript's declaration merging to fix type issues with Jest

### Next Steps
* Complete Phase 1, Step 2: Database Schema Setup
* Verify all required database schemas exist and have the correct structure
* Run tests for database schema validation
* Update progress tracking in the implementation plan

### Completed Steps

#### Step 21: Gmail API Integration

- Implemented the Gmail API integration according to the implementation plan
- Created the following API endpoints:
  - `/api/email-gmail/send`: For sending emails through Gmail
  - `/api/email-gmail/status`: For checking Gmail connection status
  - `/api/email-gmail/disconnect`: For revoking tokens and disconnecting Gmail
  - `/api/email-gmail/webhook`: For receiving notifications from Gmail
  - `/api/email-gmail/watch`: For setting up Gmail notification channels

- Key features implemented:
  1. **Authentication Flow**: Leveraging the existing OAuth flow for Gmail access
  2. **Token Management**: Implemented secure token storage and automatic refresh
  3. **Email Sending**: Completed Gmail API integration for sending emails
  4. **Email Monitoring**: Set up webhook for Gmail notifications

### Issues Encountered

- TypeScript definition for the Gmail API's `watch` method seems outdated
  - Used a simplified approach to avoid type errors
  - Further investigation needed for full implementation

### Next Steps

- Implement a background job system for processing email updates
- Create a database schema for storing email watch settings
- Build UI components for Gmail connection management
- Implement email tracking and response handling

### Decisions Made

- Used the Google OAuth 2.0 client for token refresh instead of custom implementation
- Implemented proper error handling and token refresh logic
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Used webhook-based notifications for real-time email updates
