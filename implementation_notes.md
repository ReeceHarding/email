- Updated Jest configuration to recognize tests in the __tests__ directory
- All tests for Step 1 pass successfully

*Step 2: Database Schema Setup - COMPLETED*

- Fixed linter errors in database schema tests
- Created missing database schema files:
  * contact-information-schema.ts
  * research-data-schema.ts
  * email-campaigns-schema.ts
  * email-messages-schema.ts
- Updated schema index.ts and db.ts files
- All tests for Step 2 pass successfully

*Step 3: Auth Integration - COMPLETED*

  - Automated test script to validate functionality
  - All tests are now passing

*Step 22: Email Sending Service - COMPLETED*

- Implemented email sending service with queueing, retries, and tracking:
  - Created database schema for email queue with status tracking
  - Built comprehensive queue management service
  - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Added monitoring and metrics collection
  - Created API endpoints for queue processing and monitoring
  - Developed unit and integration tests
  - Added automated test script

*Next: Step 23: Email Response Handling*

### Phase 2: Search and Query Generation
*Step 5: OpenAI Integration - COMPLETED*

- Successfully implemented a robust OpenAI client with comprehensive features:
  - API key handling with environment variable support
  - Comprehensive error handling with custom error types
  - Queue system for managing multiple requests
