This month our Staff Spotlight is our wonderful dental hygienist Melissa!Melissa grew up in the Milwaukee area and attended UW-Milwaukee for her general studies before enrolling in Waukesha County Technical College to study dental hygiene. She graduated from WCTC in 2006. After working in other areas, she joined the Wausau Smiles team as a registered dental hygienist in March of 2017. Melissa enjoys working with patients of all ages and backgrounds, though she has a special fondness for working with children. Some of the things she enjoys most about Wausau Smiles are the camaraderie among the staff and everyoneâ€™s commitment to excellent patient care. Melissa and her husband have four boys. When Melissa isnâ€™t at work, she enjoys a number of hobbies, including running, gardening, working out and watching her kidsâ€™ sports.Were so glad to have Melissa as part of our team, and we know that our patients feel the same way! ...
