    "Dr. Welles is passionate about providing optimal dental care for his patients. He is very active with both the Wisconsin Dental Association and the American Dental Association, serving in multiple leadership roles. He volunteers his time to advance the profession and promote oral health throughout the communities he serves. He also strives to stay on the forefront of dentistry through a variety of continuing education courses. Dr. Welles focuses on individualized comprehensive dental care for everyone he treats. His personalized approach promotes safe, reliable treatment for patients of all ages. He is excited to be practicing in the community where he grew up. Laying down roots amongst family and friends was an opportunity he didn&#8217;t want to pass up. He&#8217;s excited by the fact that Wausau Smiles provides outstanding dental care with its state-of-the-art facilities and patient-centered philosophy.",
    "Dr. Welles is blessed to have the love and support of family throughout his practice. His wife, Ellie, is a speech therapist working with elementary school students. They have two young sons, Benjamin and Jacob, who are active and full of happiness. They both love to ride along in their stroller exploring all that the area has to offer! The Welles family is lucky to have all of Benjamin and Jacob&#8217;s grandparents living in the Wausau area. Outside of his work, Dr. Welles loves participating in anything active. In his spare time, you can find him enjoying the outdoors with his growing family: running, biking, golfing, playing sports – anything that gets him up and moving. He is a passionate fan of all Wisconsin sports and especially enjoys the Packers, Bucks, Badgers, and Brewers.",
    "When not helping our patient family, Dr. Lina is often interacting with her own family. She grew up in a large household: she&#8217;s the youngest of eight children and has 15 nieces and nephews (and counting!). In her free time, she really likes to travel (she&#8217;s visited over 15 countries) and find new places to visit, especially new restaurants. When she&#8217;s not traveling or hanging out with her family, Dr. Lina loves to spend time with her fiancé and her two puppies, Thor and Lulu.",
    "When she&#8217;s not in the office, Lindsey is always with family and her two dogs. Some of her favorite activities are taking walks and hiking, fishing, snowboarding, and reading. One of her most memorable experiences was swimming and scuba diving with dolphins and stingrays. Lindsey is thankful for the support of her family and getting to be a part of a wonderful dental team.",
    "Outside of the office, Aubrey loves making coffee, having deep conversations, and taking long walks outside. She equally loves having a lot of family in the area as they are her #1 support system. Some other things she enjoys are running, getting to share life with her Church community, playing the piano, and watching old mystery movies. One interesting fact about Aubrey: she spent 2 years living and working on a ship that sailed around South America.",
    "I have been a patient of Dr. Aaron since he took over the practice and have always been very happy with him and his staff. Last night my 15-month-old fell and chipped her two front teeth. I had no idea what to do for her. I called the clinic and got Dr. Aaron&#8217;s emergency number. I left him a message and he called me back within 15-20 minutes. He was so calm and comforting. I was able to text him a picture and he told me that we would be fine to wait until morning to have her seen. I called the office this morning and they were able to get us in right away. He and his staff were so great with my daughter and they were able to grind down the sharp edges so she doesn&#8217;t hurt herself. I really appreciate the quick response and the time he took to talk with me after hours! I also appreciate the flexibility to get her in right away to help her out! I would highly recommend Dr. Aaron and his team to anyone looking for a dentist!",

I really appreciate the quick response and the time he took to talk with me after hours! I also appreciate the flexibility to get her in right away to help her out! I would highly recommend Dr. Aaron and his team to anyone looking for a dentist! – Tanya G. I have been a patient of Dr. Aaron since he took over the practice and have always been very happy with him and his staff. Last night my 15-month-old fell and chipped her two front teeth. I had no idea what to do for her. I called the clinic and got Dr. Aaron’s emergency number. I left him a message and he called me back within 15-20 minutes. He was so calm and comforting. I was able to text him a picture and he told me that we would be fine to wait until morning to have her seen. I called the office this morning and they were able to get us in right away. He and his staff were so great with my daughter and they were able to grind down the sharp edges so she doesn’t hurt herself. I really appreciate the quick response and the time he took to talk with me after hours! I also appreciate the flexibility to get her in right away to help her out!
