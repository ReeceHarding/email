- **Query Generation**: Started in `lib/query-generation.ts`
- **Email Service**: Foundation in `lib/email-service.ts`
- **Contact Research**: Initial implementation in `lib/contact-research.ts`

### Repository Information
- **Git Repository**: Use the existing git repository at the current working directory
- **Test Directory**: Create tests in the `__tests__` directory
- **Commit Frequently**: Commit after each step is completed and tested

### Environment Requirements
- **Node.js**: Version 18+
- **TypeScript**: Version 5.0+

10. **Update the phase progress indicators when all steps in a phase are complete.**

## Test Suite Setup

Before beginning implementation, set up the test suite with the following:

```bash
# Create test script
npm set-script test:all "jest --runInBand"

# Create individual test scripts for each checkpoint
# Example:
npm set-script test:auth "jest auth.test.ts"
npm set-script test:api "jest api.test.ts"
# Continue for all test steps
```

Good luck with the implementation!
